#  VBA of Wall Street 

## Overview of Project
In an effort to aid Steve in analyzing the performance of several Green Energy stocks for his parents, we plan to leverage VBA against stock data to parse and expose  market results of the industry occurring during the years of 2017 and 2018.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
While May has the most plays launched by month, it also has the highest success rate at 66.87%. Reviewing the months with the lowest number of launch dates, January, March, September, and December, they also show the lowest success rates.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The most successful campaigns had goals >$5000 or between $35k and $45k. The worst performing campaigns occurred when goals exceeded $45k.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset only presents beginning and ending campaign dates. Itâ€™d be great to show the pledging occur over time to better understand where/when campaigns lose their momentum.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Similar to measuring Plays, it'd be great to see a breakdown by Parent categories. Comparing the various categories we can potentially see how the campaigns pan out in different spaces.
